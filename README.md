Description: This project is designed to manage financial transactions using Excel as an interface. Transactions are stored in MongoDB Atlas. CRUD operations are done via pymongo and xlwings is used to connect Python and VBA.

Running the project:
Simply open the Excel workbook and follow the instructions on each worksheet. 

Status:
*Note currently only the v1 features are complete. As such, there is little error handling in place and users can only perform CRUD operations on the transactions themselves. 
To make the program more robust and user-friendly, v2 features include error handling, graphical analysis of the transactions, and design improvements.
